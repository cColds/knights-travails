# Description

A Knights Travails application that includes a user interface with a chess board, a knight sprite, trail, sound effects, your path (in chess notation) and how many moves it takes. It utilizes the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm and a graph data structure, with an adjacency matrix to mark visited nodes and optimize checks, to find the shortest path between two squares.

# Features
